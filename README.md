##  Running the System

1. **Start the Flask Server:**
```bash
flask --app flaskr/app.py run --host=0.0.0.0
```
> [!TIP]
> **Network Security:** > * **On Windows:** You will likely see a Windows Firewall popup. You **must** allow access for "Private Networks" for the LAN connection to work.
> * **On Debian:** No popup will appear, but if you cannot connect, ensure your firewall is configured to allow traffic on port 5000 (e.g., `sudo ufw allow 5000`).
> * The --host=0.0.0.0 flag allows the server to listen to all devices on your local network.
2. **Accessing the Hub:**
Open Google Chrome and navigate to:

> `http://127.0.0.1:5000` (Localhost)
> 
> `http://[Your-Server-IP]:5000` (Network Access)
